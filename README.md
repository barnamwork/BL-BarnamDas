# Daily Learning Progress

## Day 1

**Topics Covered:**
- Learned the fundamentals of Git
- Studied the Git Flow branching model

**Hands-on Practice:**
- Connected a local Git repository to a GitHub remote repository using SSH key generation
- Created a `README.md` file in the `main` branch to document daily progress
- Set up the Git Flow branch structure:
  - Created `main` and `develop` branches
  - Created feature branches under the `develop` branch

**Git Commands Learned:**
- `checkout`
- `merge`
- `feature`
- `release`
- `hotfix`

**Issues Faced:**
- None

## Day 2

**Topics Covered:**
- Practiced Java problems from Google Classroom to reinforce basic programming logic.
- Created a dedicated branch for daily tasks named `dailyTask` and installed Git Flow manually, improving understanding of Git branching.
- Revised core Java concepts: comments, variables, arithmetic operators, type conversion, and basic logic-based programs.

**Hands-on Practice:**
- Solved Level 1 & Level 2 Java problems including:
  - Age calculation, average marks, distance and unit conversions
  - Profit/loss calculation, fee discounts, swapping numbers
  - Simple Interest, total income, chocolate distribution
  - Input/output-based arithmetic and geometry problems

**Git Commands Learned:**
- `checkout` (created and switched branches)
- Git Flow installation and branching commands

**Issues Faced:**
- During manual Git Flow installation:
  - `getopt.exe` and `msysgit-install.exe` were not found initially.
  - After downloading these manually, Git Flow still didn’t work.
  - The issue was caused by Git Bash using the path `C:/Program Files/Git/mingw64/bin` while Git Flow was installed in `C:/Program Files/Git/bin`.
  - Manually added the correct path via CMD to make Git Flow work.
